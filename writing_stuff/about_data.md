## introduction
Music streaming service [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) transformed music listening when it first launched in 2008, and has since become the go-to method for streaming and listening to new music. 
Gone were the days of CDs and cassettes; users could now listen to high-quality music at the touch of a button. 
One of the greatest conveniences Spotify had to offer, however, was the ability to quickly create and add to playlists. 

## about the dataset

Spotify's [Million Playlist Dataset](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge) contains a million user-created Spotify playlists from between January 2010 and October 2017.
